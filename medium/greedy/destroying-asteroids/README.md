## 📝 Description
You are given an integer mass, which represents the original mass of a planet. You are further given an integer array asteroids, where asteroids[i] is the mass of the ith asteroid.

Example 1:


Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
Output: true

- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with...
